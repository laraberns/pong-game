# Pong Game Project

## Overview

The "Pong" project is a classic Pong game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the assistance of the p5.js framework. This web-based game is inspired by the iconic Atari Pong and serves as a demonstration of gameplay similar to the original.

The project also incorporates the power of ChatGPT, which played a pivotal role in generating prompts and crafting the game's code. This development aimed to hone prompt-based interaction with ChatGPT, while continuously refining and enhancing the codebase with new features and styling.

Additionally, the project utilizes MidJourney to create images and sprites, and Freesound for generating sound effects. The Web Speech API is employed to audibly announce the game's score, enhancing the overall gaming experience.
